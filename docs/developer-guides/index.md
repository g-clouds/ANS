# Developer Guides

Welcome to the developer guides for the Agent Network System (ANS). These documents provide practical, code-first examples to help you get started with the ANS SDKs.

The examples provided here are based on the internal end-to-end tests of the system, ensuring that you are building on tested and verified functionalities.

## Core Concepts

Before you begin, it's important to understand the three primary workflows that the ANS enables:

*   **[Agent Registration](./agent-registration.md):** The process of creating a unique, cryptographically secure identity for your agent and making it discoverable on the network.

*   **[Agent Lookup (Discovery)](./agent-lookup.md):** The process of finding other agents on the network by querying their name, capabilities, or other attributes.

*   **[Agent Verification](./agent-verification.md):** The process of cryptographically verifying that a claim or piece of data was genuinely authored by a specific agent and has not been tampered with.
