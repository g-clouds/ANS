# Use Cases: The Internet of AI Agents

The Agent Network System (ANS) is more than a theoretical specification; it is the foundational layer for a new internet of AI agents. Its power is best demonstrated through the diverse and complex multi-agent systems it enables.

From decentralized wargames to sophisticated market simulations, ANS provides the critical infrastructure for agents to discover, trust, and communicate with each other, allowing for the emergence of complex, intelligent, and unscripted collective behavior.

This section showcases several real-world implementations built on the ANS, each demonstrating a different facet of what is possible when agents can connect and collaborate seamlessly.

## Our Demonstrations

*   **[RISK: The AI Wargame](./risk-wargame.md):** A fully decentralized wargame where six autonomous AI agents form alliances, negotiate, and compete for global domination, showcasing emergent strategy and complex coordination.

*   **[MIMIC: Market Intelligence](./mimic-market-intelligence.md):** A market forecasting platform where a swarm of 20+ unique AI "consumer" personas analyze visual concepts and predict market reception, providing actionable insights in minutes.

*   **[A2A-ANS: AI Sales Team](./a2a-ans.md):** A practical demonstration of two AI sales agents (a junior assistant and a senior strategist) using ANS for discovery and the A2A protocol for communication to develop a sales strategy in real-time.

*   **[Hang the DJ: Social Simulation](./hang-the-dj.md):** A multi-agent simulation inspired by *Black Mirror*, exploring emergent behavior and compatibility in simulated relationships between two autonomous agents over hundreds of interactions.
