# Contributing to the Agent Network System (ANS)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ANS! We are building an open standard for the AI agent ecosystem, and we need diverse perspectives to get it right.

## How Can You Contribute?

### 1. Review the Specification
The core of ANS is the architectural specification. We need feedback on:
*   **Clarity:** Are the algorithms and flows easy to understand?
*   **Security:** Are there threat vectors we missed in the Threat Model?
*   **Completeness:** Are there use cases (e.g., healthcare, finance, robotics) we haven't covered?
*   **New Protocols:** Help us design integration patterns for emerging agent protocols.

### 2. Improve the SDKs
We currently have SDKs for Java, Python, and JavaScript. We welcome:
*   Bug fixes and performance improvements.
*   New features (e.g., better caching, async support).
*   **New Language Support:** Want to build an ANS SDK for Go, Rust, or C#? Let us know!

### 3. Documentation
*   Fix typos or unclear explanations.
*   Add new use case examples.
*   Create tutorials or "How-to" guides.
